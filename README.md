# storefront

Storefront is a venture design prototype aimed at exploring blockchain and IoT technology with a specific focus on semi-autonomous networks and micromarkets.

Storefront is a network of smart modules, which can gain insight into consumer behavior and market demand in a collaborative and dynamic way, and can be connected to very different physical trading spaces across the city, from supermarket shelves or bookstores, to traditional vending machines, making them part of a single and comprehensive market.

This repository contains three (semi) independent software prototypes:
 * [Backend](/contracts) - smart contracts
 * [Frontend](/meteor-storefront) - Dapp dashboard
 * [Market simulator](/storefront-market-simulator) and curation algorithm
